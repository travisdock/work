## Phase 2: Notes & Journaling
**Goal:** Add context and memory.

**Features:**
- Entries: progress/reflection/blocker/idea/decision/note, linked optionally to projects/tasks
- ActivityLog: automatic audit trail of actions
- Status Snapshot: recent entries, open tasks, blockers

**Value:** Project memory and continuity.

## Phase 3: AI Integration
**Goal:** Conversational layer and AI tool usage.

**Features:**
- Conversations & Messages: ask AI questions
